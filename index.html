<b>Growing up on the streets of NYC, I was a very fun-loving person who liked to travel (I'm still the same way)
A few years later, I entered the Marine Corps to see the world and get some experience.  I still love to see the world and would 
jump at every chance I get.  :-) In the Marine Corps I did almost everything I could do and could get my hands on.
I was an Aircraft Support Equipment Manager / Suprvisor when I was in the Marine Corps.  After the Marine Corps I did many odd and ends jobs - to include
military contract work, U.S. government and some schooling.</b>

<br>
All throughout my life I had been interested in technology.  In fact, I actually strted coding when I was young with BASIC, but then I stopped.
Here I am doing it again but with greater intensity. 
<br>
I intend to continue to learn more about HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  My ultimate goal would be to run my own compny / have a startup and maybe have a few military contracts.
